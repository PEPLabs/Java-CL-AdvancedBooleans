# Advanced Booleans Lab

## Pre-Requisites
You are expected to review the `Working with Basic Operators` written lecture prior to working on this lab.

## Description
In this exercise, you will practice more complex boolean operations. Boolean operators can be combined just like having multiple mathematical operators in a math equation. Like math equations, they can be combined using parentheses, where the parentheses are completed first. Otherwise, boolean operators are read left to right.

Write this boolean logic without using any if statements - that is, you should only use &&, ||, !, ==. All of these problems can be solved in a single line.

## Completing the Lab
You will be editing the file `AdvancedBooleanLogic.java`. This file can be found under the `src/main/java` package. Review the file's code and code comments for further instructions.

Tasks to complete within the `AdvancedBooleanLogic.java` file:
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `partOfString` so that it returns the correct string value.

## Running Tests
If you look within the `src/test/java` folder, you will find the Java class `AdvancedBooleanLogicTest.java`. The `src/test/java` folder will contain your test files.  

To run the tests, click on the Testing tab (test beaker icon on the left-hand side) and run the test cases by using the "Run Test" button (play icon). Please ensure that you do not already have the program running.

You can optionally run the program for manual testing by switching to the file named `Main.java` under the `src/main/java` package and clicking the "Run Java" button (play icon) on the top-right of VSCode.
